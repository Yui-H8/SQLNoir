### Case #005: The Silicon Sabotage
QuantumTech, Miami’s leading technology corporation, was about to unveil its groundbreaking microprocessor called “QuantaX.”   
Just hours before the reveal, the prototype was destroyed, and all research data was erased. Detectives suspect corporate espionage.

|263|Norman Owens|Quantum Computing|NULL|19890421|Realign Asset Trajectory|L’s schedule puts her close enough, but we need her inside F18 before 9. Trigger a minor alert or routine checkup to send her in by 8:30. Make sure she logs the visit. That part matters.|
|263|Norman Owens|Quantum Computing|NULL|19890421|Execute Phase Window|Unlock 18 quietly by 9. He’ll use his own credentials to access it shortly after L leaves. No questions. Just ensure the timing lines up. The trail will lead exactly where it needs to.|

* No sender name; Norman Owens appears to be involved in the case.
* Was Elizabeth Gordon taken advantage of?


👀 Regarding these 2 mails, I'll find person who is susupecious.
1. Date 19890421
2. L enters by 8:30
3. Access time by 8:30
